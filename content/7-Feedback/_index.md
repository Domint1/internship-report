### Overall Evaluation

My mentor provides clear explanations, structured guidance, and encourages me to think through problems independently instead of relying on direct answers. This helped me improve problem-solving skills. The admin team also works efficiently — handling paperwork, sharing needed information, and ensuring I have all required resources to complete my tasks.

During the internship, I learned how to use project management tools effectively, collaborate in a team environment, and communicate in a professional and structured way. My mentor also offered career insights that helped me better understand the skills and direction I should focus on for future development.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The team promotes a positive, respectful culture. Everyone works responsibly, supports each other, and still maintains an enjoyable atmosphere. This makes the workplace inviting and motivating.

### Additional Questions

The most satisfying part was how much I learned in such a short time. With combination of supportive guidance from my mentor, hands-on tasks, real project exposure, and opportunities to practice directly, I felt my skills improved significantly. I also felt that my work contributed meaningfully to the team.

- What do you think the company **should improve** for future interns?  
A weekly overview of office seat availability would be very helpful. It would allow interns to plan office days more proactively and avoid last-minute adjustments.

Yes, I would. The working environment is supportive, the mentorship system is strong, and the tasks provide a balanced mix of learning new skills and applying academic knowledge. It’s a place where interns can grow confidently and contribute to real projects.
