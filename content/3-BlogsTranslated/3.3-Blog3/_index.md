Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched the 2025 [AWS Imagine Grant](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/nonprofits/aws-imagine-grant-program/) cycle in six countries. The AWS Imagine Grant is a public grant opportunity open to registered nonprofit organizations who are using cloud technology to accelerate their missions. Now in its eighth year, the AWS Imagine Grant is expanding to nonprofits beyond the US, UK, and Ireland, adding Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The AWS Imagine Grant provides resources such as unrestricted financial support, [AWS Promotional Credit](https://aws.amazon.com/awscredits/), and technical support to help organizations implement their technology-driven solutions.

Cloud technology has proven to transform mission delivery for nonprofit organizations, and now cutting-edge tools like machine learning (ML) and generative AI are creating new opportunities to address urgent social and environmental challenges. AWS is committed to making these technologies available to everyone while enabling responsible deployment that centers on people. Building on the success of its US grant program, AWS is expanding its *Pathfinder – Generative AI* award to the UK this year. This initiative offers eligible nonprofits funding for generative AI projects, along with expert technical guidance through the [AWS Generative AI Innovation Center](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/innovation-center/).

## Application Details

The 2025 AWS Imagine Grant application instructions are now available for download in the [US](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/nonprofits/aws-imagine-grant-program/), [UK andIreland](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/nonprofits/aws-imagine-grant-program/aws-imagine-grant-uk/), [Canada](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/nonprofits/aws-imagine-grant-program/aws-imagine-grant-canada/), and [Australia and New Zealand](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/nonprofits/aws-imagine-grant-program/aws-imagine-grant-anz/), and application submissions begin April 14, 2025

Nonprofit organizations are encouraged to apply for the AWS Imagine Grant award category that best fits their goals – regardless of their size and mission area. Award categories, packages, and deadlines vary by region. The first application submission deadline for the grant(s) is June 2, 2025. This year’s award categories are as follows:

### The Pathfinder – Generative AI
The *Pathfinder award* is designed for highly innovative, mission-critical projects that leverage generative AI. A Pathfinder project will have the potential to produce a scaled, repeatable solution that directly accelerates mission achievement and may affect an entire industry or field. Projects in the Pathfinder category may include service types mentioned in the Go Further, Faster and Momentum to Modernize categories, but must include the use of generative AI as a required additional workload. Pathfinder projects must be built on existing data strategy and foundation, and the generative AI use case is already defined with implementation in the planning phase.

Winners for the Pathfinder – Generative AI award may receive up to $200,000 USD of unrestricted financial support and up to $100,000 USD in AWS Promotional Credit, varied by program country. Winners will receive project implementation support from the [Generative AI Innovation Center](https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/innovation-center/), as well as access to AWS training support and an opportunity for AWS marketing promotion. The Pathfinder–Generative AI award category is available in the US and the UK.

### Go Further, Faster
The Go Further, Faster award provides support for think big, highly innovative projects that leverage the cloud. These projects have the potential to produce scalable, repeatable solutions that may impact an entire industry or field. They are force multipliers for organizations and include the application of and/or seek integrations with advanced cloud services, such as AI/ML, high performance computing (HPC), internet of things (IoT), and more.

Winners for the Go Further, Faster award may receive up to $150,000 USD of unrestricted financial support and up to $100,000 USD in AWS Promotional Credit, varied by program country. Winners will gain access to project implementation guidance from AWS technical specialist(s), AWS training support, and an opportunity for AWS marketing promotion. The Go Further, Faster award category is available in the US, UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.


### 3. Momentum to Modernize
As nonprofits seek to transform and enhance their core mission operations with technology, organizations need funding for foundational technology projects, such as migrating servers to the cloud and modernizing new and existing applications. The Momentum to Modernize award provides resources for these transformational infrastructure projects, alongside AWS Promotional Credit and implementation support.

Winners for the Momentum to Modernize award may receive up to $50,000 USD of unrestricted financial support and up to $20,000 USD in **AWS Promotional Credit**. Winners will gain access to project implementation guidance from AWS technical specialists, AWS training support, and an opportunity for AWS marketing promotion. The Momentum to Modernize award category is available in the US only.
